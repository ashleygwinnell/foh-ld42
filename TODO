Feedback
good game, but i think Co2 should work differently. it would seem logical that you could stop the fire that the slugs shoot at you without just running away. i think you should be able to shoot it at the fire and put it out even if the fire is in the middle of its arc. also, if you step on a fire and lose a life, it should go out. its dumb otherwise

MAYBE DO
- greyscale when getting further into game.
- grain shader when getting further into game.

WONT DO
- some sort of forewarning on wave spawns - radial/line/area spawns.
- enemy types: does roll, large
- enemy that stays in the dark/runs from player - bat?
- enemy that avoids co2 - co2 does a knockback.
- enemy that goes towards the light - moth?
- implement pillars?
- implement initial room size?
- implement torches
- implement different room shapes
- new run cycle for player - wider legs!
- light the torches to open the hatch?
- implement colour scale for fire ammo
- doors to other rooms on the same floor?
- using fire makes the room smaller?!
- another magnet upgrade?
- bigger coins?
- tint arena. move hue slider +25 to get redder.
- stop music on changing level.
- other weapon ideas:
	- auto fire small flame lower accuracy faster shot
	- fire 3/4/5 at once
	- fire molotov cocktails/bombs that explode into multiple fires.
